# Welcome to History in T&T
This repository is a place for students in this course to practice using GitHub as well as start to synthesize what you've done in your core courses. 

We'll be using a sample Intro to T&T syllabus as one of the ways to organize both of those goals.

## Sample Syllabus
You'll practice fetching, making local additions and changes, and pushing using the collaborative sample Intro to T&T Syllabus.

## Reading Notes
This repo also provides a place where you can collaboratively write reading notes about any of the Core Reading List texts.
